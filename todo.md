## Payment Process

- [ ] Initiate payment (controller and service)

(Send some form of notifier to the admins when some errors occur e.g getting the current rate and not finding any because none exists)
The controllers for collecting currencies and assets for payment transactions should have the same validations as this will reduce discrepancy in the assets texts (e.g capital v small letters e.t.c)

Covert gas fee to the asset being withdrawn

Send Websocket event to notify user of successful coin debit?

Update address in payment service for the company wallets

Create admin guards (for rate)

<!-- Ledger Enteries Withfrawal has an entry for fee that was debited, we later transform the equivalent deducted from the user's asset back to the denominator that was debited from us and return it to the asset pool (document that too) -->

<!-- Loophole - Checking balance at every stage of transaction and Consistency - Since we can't make transactional queries. we. find another option (Esp for internal transactions)-->

<!-- 011 is statically used... remove before production -->

<!-- Used NG statically in external wallet monitoring -->

<!-- Increased the query pagination limit for transactions and Increased access token from 1h to 30d -->
<!-- Set merchant status default to verified on account creation -->
